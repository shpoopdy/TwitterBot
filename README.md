# Getting Started
If you are starting from scratch then know that there is a bit of a process that you must
undertake in order to get this going. You'll have to make your bot twitter account, go
to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new to create the bot. You will also be required to apply
for a developer account with the bot twitter you created and for me that took a day.
Once that is all squared away if you go to the above link again then you can go ahead
and fill in the details for your bot and once created you will get the Consumer Key,
 Consumer Secret, Auth Key, and the Auth Secret.

 Now that you have access to those keys and secrets you can go ahead and run the setup
  script and you will be prompted for that information, but once that is all done then
  it should be good to go. Have fun :D !


# Regular Tweet
You'll see that I have regular tweet in its own section, in a folder called google_function,
and the reason for that is because in order to use that you have to use the google sheet
api for python. If you google that the first site that pops up is Python Quickstart and when
click on that there will be a walk through on how to set up the api in your project folder
as well setting it up with the correct email account.
